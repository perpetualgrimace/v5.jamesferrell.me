    *This post was originally written for <a href="http://bermancreative.com">Berman Advertising</a>. I'm always working toward a more efficient workflow, and thought I'd share some more intuitive Keynote keyboard shortcuts.*

    ***

    As a designer, you're going to have to create a Keynote presentation now and then. There's no getting around it. And if you're coming from an app like Photoshop or Sketch, you're bound to hit those familiar keyboard shortcuts out of habit. But when nothing (or the wrong thing) happens, a wave of emotion hits you: frustration, sadness, discomfort, uneasiness, helplessness, dizziness, drowsiness,Â etc.


    You're, uh â€”Â you're withÂ me, right...?


    Yeah, so I'm a big fan of spending a bit of time up front to customize my tools in a way that makes them easier to use in the long run. The less I have to think about what I'm doing, the more efficient I can be, which means I have more time for important things like watching catÂ videos.


    *Quick aside: If you're unsure how to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for specific applications in the Apple MacOS X ecosystem, you will find instructions â€”Â andÂ aÂ gif â€” (link: #teach-me-how-to-keyboard-shortcut text: at the end of thisÂ article).*
