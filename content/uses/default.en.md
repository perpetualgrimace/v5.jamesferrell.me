## Hardware
I use a 2015 MacBook Pro with a 15" retina display, 2.2GHz i7 processor, and 16gb of RAM. It's beefy enough to get the job done. And I'm completely spoiled by theÂ screen.

## Software

### Design:
- **(link: https://www.sketchapp.com text: Sketch)** is my design software of choice. It makes web and UI design both efficient and realistic. Now if only they would implement nested character styles it would be perfect. ðŸ˜’
- **Photoshop** is amazing for editing photos (and clunky as hell for everything else).
- **(link: https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/ text: Affinity Designer)** is a generally good enough replacement for Illustrator. At this point, the less Adobe software on my Mac, theÂ better.
- **(link: https://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate text: Icon slate)** is the most friendly way I've found to make custom app icons and favicons.
- **(link: http://www.svgs.us text: svgsus)** keeps vector icon libraries at the ready, incredibly useful. It also has a very cleverÂ name.
- **(link: https://www.apple.com/keynote/ text: Keynote)** comes in handy for quick and dirty animations. Also, if I have to put a presentation together, Keynote makes me hate my life the least.


### Development:
- **(link: https://atom.io text: Atom)** is currently my code editor of choice. It's hard to argue with the cost of admission, and there is no shortage of themes and ~~plugins~~ packages. I also use it for note taking and list making.
- **(link: https://www.git-tower.com/mac/ text: Tower)** makes Git a bit more friendly and I use itÂ often.
- **Terminal** is what I use when I feel like using the command line. Which admittedly isn't often. So Terminal is good enough for me.
- **(link: https://panic.com/transmit/ text: Transit)** is the best FTP client around, if I have to use an FTP client.
- **(link: https://www.mamp.info/en/ text: MAMP)** is handy for setting up a local server, which I do whenever possible. It's also pretty essential when setting any CMS that uses an SQL database. But I try to stick to (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby CMS) so I don't have to deal with that mess.
- **(link: https://www.realmacsoftware.com/squash/ text: Squash)**, **(link: http://www.jpegmini.com text: JPEGmini)**, **(link: https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui text: svgo-gui)**, and **(link: https://imageoptim.com/ text: ImageOptim)** are all useful for quickly batch optimizing images. Which I do for every web project, because (link: blog/five-signs-that-your-website-needs-attention text: performance isÂ important).

### Essentials:
- **(link: https://www.opera.com text: Opera)** is currently my web browser of choice. It's mostly as good as Chrome and has a built in VPN.
- **(link: https://polymail.io text: Polymail)** is my email client of choice. It's the best replacement I've been able to find for Mailbox (RIP).
- **(link: https://flexibits.com/fantastical text: Fantastical)** is the perfect Calendar app. I can quickly add calendar events with human language. I'm terrible with dates, so a good calendar app is crucial.
- **(link: https://www.dropbox.com text: Dropbox)** is my home for every file that doesn't live in a git repo. I can selectively sync files so that I don't have to fill up my hard drive with files I don't need, the version control can be a lifesaver, and sharing files is dead simple.
- **(link: https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/ text: TweetBot)** is the best twitter client I've been able to find. It displays tweets in reverse chronological order, filters out keywords and hashtags, and supports multiple userÂ accounts.

### Handy utilities:
- **(link: https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture text: Giphy Capture)** is the most friendly way I've found to capture video from part of myÂ screen.
- **(link: https://fiplab.com/apps/memory-clean-for-mac text: Memory Clean)** optimizes my available RAM without me having to think aboutÂ it.
- **(link: https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac text: Copy Clip)** gives me access to my clipboard history. Which is great, because I do a lot of copying andÂ pasting.
- **(link: https://www.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/ text: BetterSnapTool)** brings over the quick window resizing behavior from Windows 7, which is literally the only Windows feature that IÂ missed after switching toÂ Mac.
- **(link: http://hocusfoc.us text: HocusFocus)** automatically hides app windows that I'm not using, which prevents window clutter without me having to think aboutÂ it.
- **(link: https://www.macbartender.com text: Bartender)** gives me control over which menu bar icons clutter up my menu bar. *Begone,Â Siri!*
- **(link: https://beardedspice.github.io text: BeardedSpice)** allows me to use the playback controls on my keyboard for sites like BandCamp andÂ YouTube.
