    ## Music & audio


    I'm currently in a progressive rock band called (link: http://waypoints.bandcamp.com text: Waypoints) and an instrumental progressive math rock project called (link: http://bigmath.bandcamp.com text: Big Math).

I've also done some (link: http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/video-game-covers text: rock tributes to a few of my favorite video game soundtracks).


    Drums are my main instrument, but I also play enough guitar and bass to get my ideas across. Lately I've been engineering all of my projects as well. Making music is an expensive and time consuming hobby, but it's an important part of my identity and it keeps me sane.
