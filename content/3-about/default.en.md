    ## About me


    I'm (link: https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/t-shaped-designers/ text: T-shaped), or (link: http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/ text: mortar), or (link: https://www.toptal.com/designers/visual/multidisciplinary-design text: multidisciplinary) â€” pick your favorite. If you have a problem, I can solve it. Or if you just want to talk about music or retro video games, I'm happy to do that too. (link: contact text: Contact me class: link-arrow epsilon)

    ### Discipline

    I always adhere to the process of my craft. It can be tempting to skip ahead, but cut corners are always visible in the end.


    ### Efficiency

    I learn my tools inside and out so that I can focus on the task at hand.


    ### Problem Solving

    I excel at clearly defining and solving problems. Just ask [my previous employer](http://bermancreative.com/blog/2015/discipline-of-self-teaching).


    ### Usability

    I build websites that the user can easily use and understand.


    ### Minimalism

    I'm a proponent of ruthlessly trimming the fat. If it isn't useful, helpful, or fun, then get rid of it.


    ### Empathy

    I'm always trying to understand other perspectives. Especially those that differ from my own.


    ### Transparency

    I'm a big proponent of open communication. Surprises lead to frustration.


    ### Humor

    Expect a bit of silliness here and there. I take my work seriously, but that doesn't mean I can't have a good time while doing it.

    ## Music & audio


    I'm currently in a progressive rock band called (link: http://waypoints.bandcamp.com text: Waypoints) and an instrumental progressive math rock project called (link: http://bigmath.bandcamp.com text: Big Math).


    By now you may have gathered that I'm really into progressive rock. ðŸ˜‚


    Before these projects, I was in an (link: http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/your-2009-ultimate-local-band-triptico text: award-winning latin rock band) called (link: http://triptico.bandcamp.com text: Triptico), briefly joined a national emocore band called (link: http://www.metalblade.com/us/artists/phoenix-mourning/ text: Phoenix Mourning) for a tour across the states, and made the first music that I wasn't embarrassed of in a modern rock band called (link: http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/broken-self text: Broken Self). I've also done some (link: http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/video-game-covers text: rock tributes to a few of my favorite video game soundtracks).


    Drums are my main instrument, but I also play enough guitar and bass to get my ideas across. Lately I've been engineering all of my projects as well. Making music is an expensive and time consuming hobby, but it's an important part of my identity and it keeps me sane.

## My resumÃ©

As you can see, I know how to make an acute accent with my keyboard. Also, of the three accepted stylings of the word resumÃ©, I prefer the version with one accent at the end.
