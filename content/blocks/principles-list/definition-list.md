----

list:
-
  title: Discipline
  text: I always adhere to the process of my craft. It can be tempting to skip ahead, but cut corners are always visible in the end.
-
  title: Efficiency
  text: I learn my tools inside and out so that I can focus on the task at hand.
-
  title: Problem Solving
  text: I excel at clearly defining and solving problems. Just ask [my previous employer](http://bermancreative.com/blog/2015/discipline-of-self-teaching).
-
  title: Minimalism
  text: I'm a proponent of ruthlessly trimming the fat. If it isn't useful, helpful, or fun, then get rid of it.
-
  title: Usability
  text: I build websites that the user can easily use and understand.
-
  title: Empathy
  text: I'm always trying to understand other perspectives. Especially those that differ from my own.
-
  title: Transparency
  text: I'm a big proponent of open communication. Surprises lead to frustration.
-
  title: Humor
  text: Expect a bit of silliness here and there. I take my work seriously, but that doesn't mean I can't have a good time while doing it.
