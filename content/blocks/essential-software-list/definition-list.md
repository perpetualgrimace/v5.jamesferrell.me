  title: Opera

  text: Currently my web browser of choice. It's mostly as good as Chrome and has a built in VPN.

  title: Polymail
  link: https://polymail.io
  text: My email client of choice. It's the best replacement I've been able to find for Mailbox (RIP).

  title: Fantastical

  text: The perfect calendar app. I can quickly add calendar events with human language. I'm terrible with dates, so a good calendar app is crucial.
-
  title: Dropbox
  link: https://www.dropbox.com
  text: Home for every file that doesn't live in a git repo. I can selectively sync files so that I don't have to fill up my hard drive with files I don't need, the version control can be a lifesaver, and sharing files is dead simple.

  title: TweetBot
  link: https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/
  text: The best twitter client I've been able to find. It displays tweets in reverse chronological order, filters out keywords and hashtags, and supports multiple userÂ accounts.
